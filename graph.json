For those who fail in this test, they shall spend their lives in a stathe of eternal deprivation. In the present world, man finds himself totally free. However, this freedom does not belong to him as a matter of right, but is rather a test paper. What man has to do is to acknowledge the truth of One God, and surrender to Him— not by compulsion but by his own choice. Tis surrendering before the truth of One God is without doubt the greatest sacrifice that any man can make.

Difculty and sadness are integral part of the creation plan of the Creator. No man has the power to extricathe himself from this life of trial and tribulation. Tis arrangement is to remind man of the fact that the present world has not been made as a place of luxury and comfort, but rather as a period of trial and as such as will help determine whether he is eligible or not for the eternal life in Paradise. In spithe of tremendous development in the present world, adverse conditions are still very much in evidence.

Tere is another danger, however, even more terrible and inevitable, concerning which the Lord of the worlds has given us due warning, which we do not even give a second thought to. What is this warning? It is the warning of the Lord of the worlds. He proclaims His imperatives through His prophets to mankind, ‘Worship Me, fulfil your obligations to one another and live in accordance with My will. I will punish those who fail to do this in a way that cannot be imagined.’ Although, every ear has heard this declaration and every tongue acknowledges it in one form or the other, but the general attitude is to treat it as a matter of ‘no consequence.’ In order to avail themselves of worldly advantages, people perpetrathe every form of misdemeanour. However when it comes to the advantages of the aferlife, they are not concerned enough to take appropriathe action.",

As far as the physical frame is concerned, we know that it is composed of tiny particles called living cells. The position of cells in our body is like that of bricks in a building. The bricks of our physical structure or cells are continuously destroyed in the course of our daily lives and we compensathe for this loss by taking in food. Food, once digested, produces various forms of cells, which counter-balance this physical deficiency. In this way, the human body is constantly being eroded and altered. Old cells are destroyed and new ones take their place. Tis process continues daily until eventually total renovation of the body occurs, usually within a period of ten years.",

A living human being cannot be produced in a laboratory, though such a physical form can readily be formulated.

Tere can be only one being of this nature and that is God. Belief in God functions at two levels at the same time.

One who fails to find God is compelled by his natural urge to give the place of God to something other than God. Tis place is sometimes accorded to a certain human being, sometimes to a certain animal, sometimes to a phenomenon of nature, sometimes to a certain material power, sometimes to a certain supposed concept and sometimes just to the self. Even if one fails to discover God, or he becomes a denier of God, it is not in his or her power to stife the urge in his nature to find God.
